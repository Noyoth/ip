## Quick Start

2. Download the latest `tbc.jar` from the releases page.
3. Place `tbc.jar` into an empty working folder.
4. Open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file, and launch the application:
   ```bash
   java -jar tbc.jar
   ```
5. Type your command into the text box and press **Enter** (or click **Send**) to execute it.

## Command Format Conventions

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` represent parameters supplied by the user.
  * Example: In `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter such as `read book`.
* Parameters in square brackets `[ ... ]` are optional.
  * Example: `place NAME [/details DETAILS]`
* Date and time arguments can be formatted as:
  * `yyyy-MM-dd` (e.g. `2026-10-15`)
  * `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` (e.g. `2026-10-15 1800`)
* The pipe character `|` is reserved for data storage and cannot be used in descriptions, details, or keywords.
* Commands and parameters are separated by spaces. Leading and trailing whitespace are automatically trimmed.
* Item indices (`INDEX`) must be positive integers starting from `1` matching the currently displayed list.
